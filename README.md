1. Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the model aims to accurately distinguish between the two categories based on image data. The primary objectives include:

* Building a CNN model from scratch using Keras and TensorFlow.
* Training the model on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
* Evaluating the model's performance and accuracy.
* Exploring potential improvements and future research directions.



## 2. Project Code

The complete implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook: [CAT\&DOG (1) (1).ipynb](https://github.com/GuduruSusmitha/cat-dog-classification/blob/main/CAT%26DOG%20%281%29%20%281%29.ipynb). The notebook encompasses the following sections:

* **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the dataset for training and testing.
* **Model Architecture**: Defining the CNN structure with appropriate layers.
* **Compilation**: Setting up the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
* **Training**: Fitting the model to the training data and monitoring performance.
* **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy on unseen test data.
* **Visualization**: Plotting training history and sample predictions.
